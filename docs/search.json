    "text": "What I think being a data scientist is all about is the ability to manipulate and visualize large datasets into actionable insights. Recently I completed my Masterâ€™s of Science in Bioinformatics, which allowed me to gain real-world and academic experience on what it is like to deal with big data on a regular basis while also being able to translate those datasets.\nOne of the main differences that I see between data scientists and statisticians is the breadth of knowledge. In my opinion, statisticians are often only required to know basic programming to complete their responsibilities, while data scientists are more often required to develop software pipelines as well as other advanced analytics.\nGiven my background in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, I see myself more aligned with being a data scientist."
